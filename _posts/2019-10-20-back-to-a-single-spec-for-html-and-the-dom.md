Coralie Mercer at the World Wide Web Consortium blog, back in May 2019:

> Today W3C and the WHATWG signed an agreement to collaborate on the development of a single version
> of the HTML and DOM specifications. The [Memorandum of Understanding jointly published as the
> WHATWG/W3C Joint Working Mode](https://www.w3.org/2019/04/WHATWG-W3C-MOU.html) gives the specifics
> of this collaboration.

That announcement is now reflected [in this pull
request](https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/4993/commits/2b193e1f5e70c312449bd2fb6a3c5859f78321e0)
at the WHATWG. The return to a single, shared  specification for HTML and another for the DOM, is
good news for developers, browser makers, and those of us who pitch in to make dev-friendly
documentation over on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/). It’s also important, I think,
that the WHATWG “living standard” is what will live on, rather than the post-hoc versioned HTML 5.x
specifications the W3C had been publishing.
