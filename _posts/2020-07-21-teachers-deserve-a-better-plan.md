National treasure Dave Grohl:

> America’s teachers are caught in a trap, set by indecisive and conflicting sectors of failed
> leadership that have never been in their position and can’t possibly relate to the unique
> challenges they face. I wouldn’t trust the U.S. secretary of percussion to tell me how to play
> “Smells Like Teen Spirit” if they had never sat behind a drum set, so why should any teacher trust
> Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos to tell them how to teach, without her ever having sat at the
> head of a class? (Maybe she should switch to the drums.) Until you have spent countless days in a
> classroom devoting your time and energy to becoming that lifelong mentor to generations of
> otherwise disengaged students, you must listen to those who have.

I’m old enough to remember the early days of the pandemic, when teachers were lauded as heroes.
