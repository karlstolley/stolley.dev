It’s always a happy thing when the bi-product of research or teaching prep results in a small
improvement someplace else.

In this case, I submitted a pull request to update the compatibility data for Mozilla Developer
Network’s browser compatibility data for [the `<data>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/data)
and [its corresponding `HTMLDataElement` DOM interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDataElement)
in Safari, which [Apple’s documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkitjs/htmldataelement)
suggests has been supported since Safari’s SDK version 10 on both macOS and iOS.
