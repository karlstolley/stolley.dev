A really solid read on disability and innovation, including a story I’d not heard about the origins
of Apple’s touchscreen technology.

I can’t say I’ve heard of *lead user design* before (user-lead design, sure, but I’m guessing that
*lead user design* is pronounced *LEED*, not *LED*).

Money quotation for the entire article, one that will surely resonate with students I'm teaching
accessible web design to this semester:

> we need to recognize a disability not as a medical condition but as a mismatch in capabilities

Yup.
