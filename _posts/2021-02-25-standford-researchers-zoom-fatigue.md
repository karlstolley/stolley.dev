An article about psychology as well as interface design:

On its surface, video seems like it would add a more personal dimension to a connection. But it’s
too different from the in-person conversations that most everyone craves after a year living in a
pandemic.

A few of my friends and some of my professional colleagues have found ourselves deliberately trying
to hold more audio-only chats when possible. (Fun fact that too few Apple users seem to know: You
can have [audio-only chats on FaceTime](https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/make-facetime-audio-call/)
with crystal-clear audio, even
[on your Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/messages/facetime-audio-calls-icht1091/mac).)
