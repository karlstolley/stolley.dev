Jonathan Hoefler, lambasting *The Quick Brown Fox...* and other pangrams for examining type
specimens:

> Pangrams are unctuous little brain ticklers, challenging to concoct, droll to read, and immensely
> popular for presenting fonts.

> I find them singularly useless in type design, and I don’t use them in my work.

Hoefler’s solution is really smart, and there are different samples for lowercase, uppercase, and
small caps.
