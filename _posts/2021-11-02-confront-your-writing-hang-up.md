With
[#PragProWriMo](https://medium.com/pragmatic-programmers/pragprowrimo-starts-november-1st-39329b7ea346)
off and running this November, I wanted to share some of what I’ve been thinking about becoming a
better writer. Not by looking at the best of how I write, but at the worst. Motivation only gets you
so far if, like me, you’ve got a hang-up about your writing.

Simple truths: Everyone writes. Some of us enjoy it. Most of us don’t. And consciously or not,
almost everyone has some kind of hang-up about writing that represents anything from a mild
difficulty on up to a root cause of writer’s block, or even a nagging voice that tells you, *Sorry,
you’re not a writer.*

Let me tell you about my hang-up with writing. I’ll even demonstrate it for you:

I’m a writer who’s still recovering from graduate school, where you’re positively reinforced—and
often richly rewarded with praise and publications—to write extraordinarily complex sentences (no
matter what the topic); the more complex the sentence,  the more the need to avoid, as long as
possible, any kind of terminal punctuation: a sentence-ending period, for example, completes a
thought, and no thought is ever complete—so eventually you end up using every piece of punctuation
on your keyboard (parentheses, commas, em-dashes, colons, semicolons), and the sentence you’ve
constructed spans several lines, and it ends up in a completely different place from where it
started.

That’s my hang-up, on full display in that sentence, right there. If you read that whole thing, I’m
so sorry.

Sentences like that are what I’ve been working on hardest to improve about my writing for many
years. I’ve been making some progress, I guess, because it was actually kind of painful instead of
natural to write that terrible, embarrassing demonstration above.

The worst thing about my hang-up with avoiding terminal punctuation is that I write sentences that
are beyond saving. They’ve got so many twists and turns that there’s very little that can be saved
or properly edited. Those kinds of sentences take on a life and trajectory all their own. I can’t
control them any better when I’m trying to fix them than I could on a first draft.

You’ve probably heard writerly advice like “Just let it out! Draft and just keep going!” I have,
too, but it has never worked for me without producing the kinds of awful sentences like I
demonstrated above. “Just keep going” is the worst thing I can let myself do, because my hang-up is
that I *will* just keep going. And going. And going. Real
[Energizer Bunny](https://www.energizer.com/energizer-bunny/bunny-timeline) stuff.

So I edit myself as I write. (Note that that is no substitute for having someone, especially a
professional, edit your writing). And by constantly working on my writing, I know the kinds of bad
habits I have. After I’ve fixed the worst ones, I can see others: I make myself keep my subjects
near my verbs. I try to be sparing about dropping fancy inductive sentences, and instead go
with a straight-up subject-verb-object pattern. Usually.

At best, the end result is improved clarity. Or at least the writing isn’t getting in the way of the
material I’m trying to convey. Especially when writing on technical subjects, there’s plenty of
confusion in the mix already—no matter how skilled a writer you are.

Maybe you’ve got anxiety about your command of grammar (everyone does). Maybe you’re laboring under
a bunch of silly myths and lies about writing that you were taught in school: “Never use I,” “Never
start a sentence with a conjunction,” or “Never end a sentence with a preposition.” Those are all
lies. Maybe you think your writing sounds boring, or maybe you think you’ve not got a big enough
vocabulary.

But here’s the thing about a writing hang-up: you’ve got to acknowledge it and hit it head on,
whatever it is. Don’t let it become the excuse not to write. Let it be the thing you decide to
fix—not before you write, but *as* you write.

Take my hang-up with long and winding sentences. I’ve found a technique for countering it. And
that’s to writing by authors who do exactly the *opposite* of whatever I’m trying to fix in my own
writing. Less David Foster Wallace, more Virginia Woolf.

To get myself primed to write, I often read a few punchy, staccato sentences by someone like Hunter
S. Thompson, something like this short passage from his classic “The Kentucky Derby is Decadent and
Depraved”:

> Steadman is now worried about fire. Somebody told him about the clubhouse catching on fire two
> years ago. Could it happen again? Horrible. Trapped in the press box. Holocaust. A hundred
> thousand people fighting to get out. Drunks screaming in the flames and the mud, crazed horses
> running wild. Blind in the smoke. Grandstand collapsing into the flames with us on the roof. Poor
> Ralph is about to crack. Drinking heavily, into the Haig.

That’s a whole paragraph with only two pieces of non-terminal punctuation (a couple of commas). As
an added bonus, it’s funny. It’s visual. It creates a scene. And that activates the better, more
creative parts of my brain.

Writing to teach others about technology requires stringing together a lot of complex ideas. A short
passage like that is enough to remind me that I can have a complete thought or idea (like Thompson’s
burning clubhouse at the Kentucky Derby) *and* that I can convey it in a number of short, punchy
sentences.

I work on my writing hang-up as a pet project of personal and professional improvement. But that’s
really secondary to what I’m trying to do for readers. Every period is a place to rest. A short
sentence invites a reassuring, I’ve-got-this re-read for uncertain readers. If readers can retread
small or at least manageable steps, they’ll be able to follow me—wherever I try to take them. There
is no need to try to do that in one massive sentence.

Or so I keep having to tell myself.
