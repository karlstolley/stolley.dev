I happened upon [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net) via
[this blog post comparing it with the upward bloat-trajectory of Dropbox](https://tonsky.me/blog/syncthing/).

From Syncthingâ€™s home page:

> Syncthing is a continuous file synchronization program. It synchronizes files between two or more
> computers in real time, safely protected from prying eyes. Your data is your data alone and you
> deserve to choose where it is stored, whether it is shared with some third party, and how it's
> transmitted over the internet.

I think one of my weekend projects is going to be to give this thing a try, including on a headless
Raspberry Pi.
