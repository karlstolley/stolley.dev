Tim Brown, in his arguably classic 2016 post, "Flexible Typography with CSS Locks":

> CSS locks are useful for more than just typography. Use them wherever you need specific fluid behavior, contained within certain boundaries. “CSS locks” is a name I’m using for a specific kind of value calculation. I hope it’ll make communication easier and this concept more useful.

I've been thinking a lot about this article as I've been putting together my
[Fundamentals of Web Development](https://courses.stolley.co/fwd/) for the fall semester, especially
the place of the CSS `calc()` function.

Early thought: limiting the number of CSS *properties* up front, and spending more time with the
language's features (media queries, functions, and so forth).
