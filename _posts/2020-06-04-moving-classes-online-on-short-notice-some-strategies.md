I put together [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mZZZSmz2UGt6lHvhp6y09rknJnKfandQtDnlZcunTmI/)
back in March 2020, when college faculty were rushing to move their courses online.

In the months since, I’ve gotten a few nice notes about it. I received another this morning, from a
professor in Toronto who wanted to repurpose parts of it for her colleagues. That request prompted
me to do what I should’ve done long ago and explicitly license the work under a permissive [Creative
Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) license.

And to make it more easily shareable, I've used [my link shortener](https://github.com/karlstolley/sharty)
to create a simple link: [https://ks4.us/short-notice](https://ks4.us/short-notice)
