Gal Shachar is offering the hard sell on headless content management systems:

> A truly headless CMS eliminates the head portion altogether, leaving just the back end. In other
> words, there’s no dedicated system for front-end presentation. And while you might initially
> wonder if this type of structure might be to your disadvantage, it’s actually the best way to
> display content to your site visitors on all devices and interfaces, putting your agency in the
> best possible position to scale.

A good overview of alternative CMS-oriented web strategies. But headless introduces new problems
for content wholly decoupled from the web. HTML has a job to do, and it does it well.
