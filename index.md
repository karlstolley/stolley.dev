  <h2>I’m a web developer, technical author & speaker, and developer educator.</h2>
</header>

As a front-end-oriented full-stack developer, I prioritize accessibility, open standards, and
readable but performant code.

I coach and mentor other developers by example in all of my professional work: not only by how I
program, but also by how I communicate and collaborate.

  <p>
    <i>From the publisher</i>: With WebRTC, you’ll create real-time applications to stream any kind of
    user media and data directly from one browser to another, all built on familiar HTML, CSS, and
    JavaScript. Power real-time activities like text-based chats, secure peer-to-peer file transfers,
    collaborative brainstorming sessions—even multiplayer gaming. And you’re not limited to two
    connected users: an entire chapter of the book is devoted to engineering multipeer WebRTC apps
    that let groups of people communicate in real time. You’ll create your own video conferencing app.
    It’s all here.
